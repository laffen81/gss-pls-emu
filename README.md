> Reversible target system built for Arduino.

## Why
The existing PLS-controlled system malefunctioned and we needed a new cheap solution. An Arduino combined with the code resulted
in a fully working system integrated into the existing infrastructure. 


## Components
The solution consists of a Arduino UNO, a LCD panel, a relay and three buttons controlling the program.

## Functions

1. LCD menu with the possibillity to select one of the 8 predefined programs.
2. Hard stop (while running a program).
3. Supports multiple runs of the same program.
4. Built in counter for repeating programs.
